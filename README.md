## Background

Initially I did a sort of lightweight [ADR](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) for this design, but it became a bit lengthy. I have worked to keep it simple. 

I have used PlantUML to create the C4 [container](https://c4model.com/diagrams/container). There is a [VSC Plugin for PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) that can render my [diagram](./diagrams/container.puml). There are two older diagrams in the directory, one a context and the other a general pattern for a lambda service on AWS. I left them out of the document, finally, to opt for brevity.

All diagrams will be in the `/diagrams` folder. The top level [System Design](./design.md) document will hold the entire solution.

You will find a PDF that holds the rendered design document [here](./design.pdf).
